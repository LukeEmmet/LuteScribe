=== Active notes ===


New data format: can parse TAB, JTZ, JTXML, FT3 well, and FT2 very rudimentary
cannot parse: multi-piece FT3

=== General ===

This document contains list of changes, bugs and thoughts for the future, and todo list

=== bugs to fix soon ===

=== TBD ==
Bind to Selected items so user can delete a selection of chords (current build you can only delete one)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9880589/bind-to-selecteditems-from-datagrid-or-listbox-in-mvvm. But suggests binding
to object.IsSelected might not work for virtualised data grids...

 - check for fretted bourdons on 9th course and below - e.g. //c //e etc. (rare?)

=== CHANGES ===


v1.0.4

v1.0.2

 - selecting a new stave visually deselects elements from the previously selected stave
 - added wait cursor for longer actions such as reflow and generate midi output
 - new options to play selection or from selection
 - added option to play piece using midi (default speed 1.5)
 - can only now delete all but the last stave in a piece
 - new command to delete the current Stave
 - added Edit->Cut to allow moving chords more easily
 - added menu Edit->Select all, to select all on current stave
 - new command line parameter "--load-previous" to load the last opened file
 - better indentation of different types of element under Insert menu

 - commit pending edits before switching to preview
 - insert bar line or blank item before current as well as after
 - cursor keys commit current edit (more like a spreadsheet)
 - delete key now just clears the current cell or selected chords (more like a spreadsheet)
 - better visual style for focussed cell - slightly more prominent

v1.0.1

 - better bourdon detection in ft3
 - fingered diapasons on 8th course (e.g. /c /e etc) - see Samples\ft3\14a_langton_pavane.ft3 for an example
 - rudimentary undo - undoes back to the last snapshot recorded during: menu command, paste, delete 
   no fine grained undo yet of cell editing 
 - the "x" flag or TAB is no longer needed during editing, resulting in a cleaner looking display.
 - empty line break between headers and body no longer needed when loading TAB files
 - when loading ft3/jtxml files author and title are now shown at top of front sheet
 - can now set default flag and character styles when none explicitly specified (default "standard" ones from TAB
   not very attractive)
 - more attractive display of first element if it is a barline
 - new option to control whether the last stave is padded at the end with a flourish (otherwise can result in
   strange stretching of sparse content  by TAB)
 - generating PDF shows piece number in exported file name for multi-section files
 - better handling of empty elements when generating TAB
 - added unit test framework
 - can get multi-pieces from JTXML, LSML, TAB (delimited "#=== new section ===")
 - LSML format updated to support multiple pieces, and loads legacy beta LSML files
 - now works with files containing multiple pieces
 - works with Wine
 - now remembers the last print view settings to show 2 pages
 - now reopens using the same tab as last time (good for using as a viewer)
 - now opens JTZ and JTXML if JtxmlParser is found
 - now generates PDF and can preview output
 - announcement and beta testing
 - improve cell highlight model - so it is clearer to see the dotted border
 - use Advanced installer
 - installer to register fonts
 - installer to create shortcuts to application and documentation
 - contact author of LeRoy fonts for re-use (Steve Horn)
 - wrote to Wayne Cripps to inform about upcoming release
 - user documentation
 - build a release and installer
 - test installer on another machine
 - application icon added
 - help integrated into menu system
 - load italian tabulature
 - save as TAB
 - resize to fit content on editing cell
 - persist any user settings (e.g. stavewrap)
 - support Ft3 missing flags (continue previous)
 - added revert feature
 - strip comments command
 - added SaveAs - for general use (pass command parameter = "1")
 - reorganise files so rebol/gzip in sub folders
 - saving Ps files with original not in Data folder
 - better error handling, at least for file open
 - disabled menus to move between staves (not working yet)
 - better font for headers options
 - font colour: black if flag or symbol, dark grey if less frequent, light grey if ^[bBx]$, red if ^e$
 - font family: luteflags or arial in flags, leroy notes only in stave area
 - font sizes: large if flag or symbol, medium if less frequent, small if ^[bBx]$
 - load italian tabulature
 - insert stave before/after current
 - remove text box binding to viewmodel.path
 - remove maxsize property on stave (obsolete)
 - user option to specify wrap length
 - file->exit exits application
 - be able to open both zipped ft3 and plain ft3 - may be determined by version of fronimo
 - copy/paste
 - merge open ft, tab, lsml into single dialog
 - parse ft3 by reading CArchive format (mfc serialisation)
 - better tab parsing - e.g. ornaments, fingering and capriola ghost notes
 - support full header list


=== Maybe ===

 - offer to save changes when doing file/open/import if active session
 - cut (as it copy/paste)
 - better tools to organise headers (insert before after current)
 - navigate between staves using the keyboard and focus shifting

=== Nice to have

 - on opening TAB that is not fully supported (e.g. with mensural staves plus tab) would be nice to give a warning, 
 - user options to control font selection and colours for each type of item
 - user can specify default settings for new project
 - nested menus by category
 - apply flag to current chord as well as insert new chord
 - user generic flags for running tab (general preferences)
 - user can turn on and off the fancy font/colours/sizes
 - some way of visually indicating line of vertical dots

=== Bugs/issues ===

 - for some reason rebol2.exe from commandline on Win64 does not return content on stdout. Adjusted to write to a file instead :-/
  (but no difference... maybe it is something to do with the fact that the script argument passed to the path does not get loaded
   for some reason...?)
  story seems to be that rebol2.exe cannot load a file (silent fail) if the passed path contains "c:\program files (x86)" - otherwise OK
  (ok for admin and non-admin) - on windows 10 64 bit. 
  relative paths including ..\ are ok
  FIXED - use relative path for rebol2 script.
 - REBOL exe cannot seem to open file from UNC drive at present, but this is OK as we copy to temp folder before opening


=== The future ===

 - show comments with a clickable glyph with tooltip, not full text
 - integrated raw text editor for TAB
 - detect file change and reload TAB?

=== TAB parsing ==

 - get ornaments onto same note as they apply
 - detect if complex tab with music plus tab - abort loading this, or just load tab
 - misses extra text if it comes just before bar line e.g. [Foo}\nb e.g. fuen_contra_08
 - misses P9 - pagination - e.g. fuen_contra_08
 - misses line length directives like this -l "4.0 in" -  e.g. 001_FMRicercar01
 - misses directives like this: t#1 a and #tx   a (ties across a bar line?) - e.g. 01_bossinensis_recercar
 - misses directive i on a line on its own (indent a bit) e.g. Capirola_Recercar_ottavo


=== Fronimo parsing ===

 - more improvements

=== Focus model ===

 - would be good to be able to set focus programmatically, e.g. for
   keyboard navigation across staves
