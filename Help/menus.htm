        <h1>Menus</h1>

        <p>Here we summarise the behaviour of LuteScribe's menu commands.</p>
		<h3>File</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>New</dt>
			<dd>Creates a new blank file.</dd>
			<dt>Open</dt>
			<dd>Opens a file in one of the following formats: LSML, TAB, FT3, 
			FT2. See <a href="import.htm">import compatibility</a> for details 
			of any compatibility issues when loading TAB, FT3 or FT2 formats.</dd>
			<dt>Save</dt>
			<dd>Saves the current edited content as LSML (LuteScribe XML format) 
			or TAB.</dd>
			<dt>Save As</dt>
			<dd>Saves the current content to a new location.</dd>
			<dt>Export</dt>
			<dd>Export as PDF - creates a PDF file within the same folder as the 
			current tabulature file. <br><em>Note that some PDF viewers such as Adobe 
			Acrobat lock the PDF file being viewed, in which case LuteScribe 
			cannot overwrite the file. If it this occurs, simply close the file 
			in Acrobat and then you can resave the PDF from LuteScribe</em></dd>
			<dt>Print preview</dt>
			<dd>Previews the current piece (shown in the third tab). 
			See <a href="printing-save-pdf.htm">preview, printing and saving PDF</a> 
			for further details.</dd>
			<dt>Print</dt>
			<dd>Prints the current file to a chosen printer.</dd>
			<dt>Recent files</dt>
			<dd>Shows a list of the most recent files opened.</dd>
			<dt>Exit</dt>
			<dd>Exits LuteScribe</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Edit</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Undo</dt>
			<dd>Reverts back to a recent snapshot of the content, created when 
			running a menu command, paste, delete items.</dd>
			<dt>Redo</dt>
			<dd>Reverts the most recent undo.</dd>
			<dt>Cut</dt>
			<dd>Moves the content onto the clipboard for pasting.</dd>
			<dt>Copy</dt>
			<dd>Copies the currently selected chords onto the clipboard. </dd>
			<dt>Paste</dt>
			<dd>Paste the content of the clipboard before the currently selected 
			chord.</dd>
			<dt>Select all</dt>
			<dd>Selects all the chords on the current stave.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Chord</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Insert blank chord</dt>
			<dd>Inserts an empty chord before or after the current selection</dd>
			<dt>Insert bar line</dt>
			<dd>Inserts a simple bar line before or after the current selection. An empty 
			chord can also be converted to a bar line by setting its flag to &quot;b&quot; 
			or &quot;B&quot;</dd>
			<dt>Delete chord</dt>
			<dd>Deletes the currently selected chord. You can also delete 
			selected items using [DEL] on your keyboard.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Insert</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><i>&lt;Various items&gt;</i></dt>
			<dd>Insert the chosen item after the current selection. Each item is 
			a shortcut to a common <a href="tab-commands.htm">TAB command</a>. 
			These and any other TAB commands can be inserted manually since you can also edit the current chord directly as needed.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Stave </h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Insert stave break</dt>
			<dd>Inserts a new stave after the current selection. This new stave 
			will contain any chords after the selection.</dd>
			<dt>Join with next stave</dt>
			<dd>Deletes the end of the current stave. As a result any chords on 
			the following stave will be added to the end of the currently 
			selected stave.</dd>
			<dt>Insert new stave </dt>
			<dd>Inserts an empty stave before or after the currently selected 
			stave.</dd>
			<dt>Delete stave</dt>
			<dd>Deletes the currently selected stave. You cannot delete the last remaining 
                    stave in a piece - there must be at least one.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3><a name="tools"></a>Tools</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Reflow all</dt>
			<dd>Reflows all the bars of the current file so to fit within the 
			specified <a href="options.htm">stave wrap</a> value. The approach 
			taken is that a whole number of bars are shown on each stave up to 
			the stave wrap value.</dd>
			<dt>Set grid flag styles</dt>
			<dd>Updates all grid flags in the current file to use the preferred 
			style. Both styles are supported by TAB, but the N# format is 
			preferred by some as it shows the flag element first, so lines up 
			better with the rest of the chord.</dd>
			<dt>Remove comments from staves</dt>
			<dd>Removes any chords that are comments, namely begin &quot;%&quot; on the 
			flag line. This can result in simpler files. Comments in
			<a href="editing-headers.htm">headers</a> are not affected.</dd>
