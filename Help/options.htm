        <h1>Options tab</h1>
		<p>The 3rd tab on the main window provides access to the following user 
		preferences and options.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Stave wrap</dt>
			<dd>Sets the maximum number of chord elements per stave 
			when reflowing the bars of the piece (see <a href="menus.htm#tools">reflow 
			all</a> menu command). The algorithm repositions the stave breaks 
			within the piece according to the number of bars created. Each stave 
			is updated to have a whole number of bars, where the total number of 
			chords does not exceed the Stave wrap value. You can adjust this 
			value to put more or fewer chords on each stave.</dd>
			<dt>Pad last stave with flourish</dt>
			<dd>Normally TAB will space out the elements to fit the stave. On 
			the last stave in a piece this can look unattractive, particularly 
			if there are not many notes on that stave. This option pads out the 
			last stave with empty elements and adds a final flourish (if none is 
			already provided). This usually makes the last stave in a piece more 
			visually appealing. It does not alter the content of the file, but 
			just when the output display is created.</dd>
			<dt>Associate file extensions (FT3, TAB, LSML)</dt>
			<dd>Sets the Windows file association for these file 
			types to open in LuteScribe. Once set you will be able to double 
			click on one of these tabulature file types in Windows Explorer and 
			it will open in LuteScribe</dd>
			<dt>Default flag style</dt>
			<dd>Sets the default flag style used when previewing a piece when 
			none is specified in the headers. The default one - <em>standard</em> 
			- used by TAB can be harder to read, and the <em>thin</em> style is 
			recommended.</dd>
			<dt>Default character style</dt>
			<dd>Sets the default character style used when previewing a piece 
			when none is specified in the headers. The default one - <em>
			standard</em> - used by TAB is less visually balanced than others 
			(particularly <em>f, b </em>and<em> d</em> characters, so the <em>
			robinson</em> style is recommended.</dd>
            <dt>Default playback instrument</dt>
			<dd>Sets the default instrument used for <a href=playback.htm>audio playback</a> 
			when none is specified in the headers. </dd>
            
            <dt>Default playback tempo</dt>
			<dd>Sets the default tempo for <a href=playback.htm>audio playback</a> when none is specified in the headers. 
              The relative speeds are as follows: Slower (75%), Normal (100%), Faster (150%) and 2 x tempo (200%).
              You will find that different pieces sound better at different playback tempos.</dd>
            
			<dt>Show debug log</dt>
			<dd>Shows a debug log of the interactions with some of the 
			supporting systems that LuteScribe uses. This is useful for 
			debugging, but otherwise not important for normal use of LuteScribe.</dd>
