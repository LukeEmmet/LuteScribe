        <h1>Known issues and bugs</h1>
		
        <h3>Bugs</h3>
            <ul>
            
                <li>Support for Fronimo FT2 files is very limited. Workaround: 
				ask the file's author to generate a TAB or FT3 file, which will 
				open better.</li>
				<li>Visual formatting - complex bar lines (e.g. bB etc) do not 
				display fully in stave view.</li>
            </ul>
		<h3>Possible future enhancements</h3>
		<p>The following might be implemented in the future, depending on level 
		of interest. These are shown in a rough order of importance. Feel free 
		to submit source code patches for these.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide warning and fail to try to open any TAB file containing 
			both tabulature and standard notation.</li>
			<li>Improved FT3 parsing to extract fingering, ornaments on each 
			note.</li>
			<li>improved FT3 parsing to extract other bar information such as 
			bar line variations, repeat marks, time signature.</li>
			<li>Keyboard navigation between staves (e.g. via cursor keys).</li>
			<li>Keyboard option or user option to go to lower course after edit, 
			not next chord on same course.</li>
			<li>MIDI export - via relevant TAB option.</li>
			<li>More user control over the fonts and styles.</li>
			<li>Preview a selection of content using popup window to show what 
			the current elements will render as.</li>
			<li>More compact elements within stave (or user option)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Rejected future features constraints</h3>
		<p>The following features are unlikely to be implemented.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>No support for TAB files containing both tabulature and standard 
			notation.</li>
		</ul>
