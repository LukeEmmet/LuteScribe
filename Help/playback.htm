        <h1>Audio playback</h1>

        <p>LuteScribe provides a simple playback feature to preview the piece being edited. To hear the current piece, choose the
        relevant option from the <i>Tools</i> menu. This feature makes use of TAB's inherent midi creation facility, and the audio
        is then rendered using a high quality, sample based software synthesizer.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Play current piece - plays the whole piece from its start.</li>
            <li>Play selection - playback the currently selected chords. For example if you want to hear a couple of bars or similar.</li>
            <li>Play from selection - plays the piece from the selected chord.</li>
            <li>Play current stave - plays the chords in the currently selected stave.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Playback window</h3>
        
        <p>The following window will be shown. While the playback window is shown you can continue to edit the piece or page through its rendered 
        output. To hear any updates following your edits, simply regenerate the playback piece from the relevant item on the <i>Tools</i> menu.</p>
        
        <p class="text-center">
		<a href="images/playback.png">
		<img  width=200px src="images/playback.png"></a></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The buttons on the playback window are the typical ones for audio playback of a single piece, namely:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop - stops the playback and resets to the beginning of the output</li>
            <li>Pause - pauses the plaback</li>
            <li>Play - plays after the output has been stopped or paused.</li>
        </ul>        

        <h3>Playback tempo and instrument</h3>
        
        <p>By default the playback speed will any tempo set in the piece's headers, otherwise the user default playback preferences from the <a href=options.htm>options tab</a>. </p>
        
        <p>Four different playback instruments and playback speed are available. You may find different pieces sound better at different speeds</p>.
