Version 2, June 1991</P>
<P>&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, 
Inc.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; 
USA<BR>&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<BR>&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Preamble</P>
<P>&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your<BR>freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General 
Public<BR>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
free<BR>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; 
This<BR>General Public License applies to most of the Free 
Software<BR>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
to<BR>using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
by<BR>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it 
to<BR>your programs, too.</P>
<P>&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, 
not<BR>price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get 
it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in 
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P>&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the 
rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if 
you<BR>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P>&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
that<BR>you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
the<BR>source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know 
their<BR>rights.</P>
<P>&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, 
and<BR>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to 
copy,<BR>distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make 
certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this 
free<BR>software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed 
on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, 
so<BR>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the 
original<BR>authors' reputations.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by 
software<BR>patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a 
free<BR>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making 
the<BR>program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that 
any<BR>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at 
all.</P>
<P>&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and<BR>modification follow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</P>
<P>&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which 
contains<BR>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be 
distributed<BR>under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The 
"Program", below,<BR>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program"<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of 
it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into 
another<BR>language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in<BR>the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".</P>
<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are 
not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act 
of<BR>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the 
Program<BR>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on 
the<BR>Program (independent of having been made by running the 
Program).<BR>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Program's<BR>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you<BR>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate<BR>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all 
the<BR>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty;<BR>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
License<BR>along with the Program.</P>
<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any 
portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy 
and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 
1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent 
notices<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, 
that in<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the 
Program or any<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at 
no charge to all third<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this 
License.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands 
interactively<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started 
running for such<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, 
to print or display an<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an 
appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no 
warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and 
that users may redistribute the program under<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is 
interactive but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an 
announcement, your work based on<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.)</P>
<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; 
If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Program,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works 
in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to 
those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when 
you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work 
based<BR>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
it.</P>
<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on 
the Program.</P>
<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
Program<BR>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume 
of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work 
under<BR>the scope of this License.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on 
it,<BR>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms 
of<BR>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed 
under the terms of Sections<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least 
three<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more 
than your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source 
distribution, a complete<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the 
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily 
used for software interchange; or,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to 
the offer<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; 
(This alternative is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in 
object code or executable form with such<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in 
accord with Subsection b above.)</P>
<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making 
modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<BR>code means 
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>associated 
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>control compilation and 
installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<BR>special exception, the 
source code distributed need not include<BR>anything that is normally 
distributed (in either source or binary<BR>form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system on which the executable 
runs, unless that component<BR>itself accompanies the executable.</P>
<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as<BR>distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the 
Program<BR>except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any 
attempt<BR>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program 
is<BR>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
License.<BR>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you 
under<BR>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as 
such<BR>parties remain in full compliance.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have 
not<BR>signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify 
or<BR>distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions 
are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, 
by<BR>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on 
the<BR>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, 
and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying<BR>the Program or works based on it.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on 
the<BR>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from 
the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject 
to<BR>these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any 
further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties 
to<BR>this License.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of 
patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement 
or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do 
not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you 
cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under 
this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
you<BR>may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a 
patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program 
by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</P>
<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>circumstances.</P>
<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe 
any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of 
any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting 
the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system, which 
is<BR>implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have 
made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of 
that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is 
willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot<BR>impose that choice.</P>
<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted 
in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Program under this 
License<BR>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding<BR>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among<BR>countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License 
incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
versions<BR>of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new 
versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in 
detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the 
Program<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
"any<BR>later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions<BR>either of that version or of any later version published by the 
Free<BR>Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version 
number of<BR>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
Software<BR>Foundation.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other 
free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author<BR>to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the 
Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the 
two goals<BR>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and<BR>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
NO WARRANTY</P>
<P>&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; 
EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER 
PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS<BR>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; 
SHOULD THE<BR>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING,<BR>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>
<P>&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR<BR>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
DAMAGES,<BR>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING<BR>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT 
LIMITED<BR>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED 
BY<BR>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
OTHER<BR>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE<BR>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to 
Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</P>
<P>&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the 
greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make 
it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
terms.</P>
<P>&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is 
safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at 
least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is 
found.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea 
of what it does.&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; 
&lt;name of author&gt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License as published by<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; 
either version 2 of the License, or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any 
later version.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied 
warranty of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more 
details.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public 
License<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free 
Software<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, 
Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA</P>
<P><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper 
mail.</P>
<P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like 
this<BR>when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of 
author<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for 
details type `show w'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are 
welcome to redistribute it<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type 
`show c' for details.</P>
<P>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the 
commands you use may<BR>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; 
they could even be<BR>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your 
program.</P>
<P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or 
your<BR>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, 
if<BR>necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:</P>
<P>&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the 
program<BR>&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by 
James Hacker.</P>
<P>&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<BR>&nbsp; Ty Coon, 
President of Vice</P>
<P>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
into<BR>proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you 
may<BR>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with 
the<BR>library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library 
General<BR>Public License instead of this License.
