        <p>This is the user help guide for LuteScribe</p>
		
        <h2>What is LuteScribe?</h2>
        
		
        <p>LuteScribe is a Windows application for viewing and editing musical 
		tabulature for lutes and related historical instruments. It offers an 
		editing window to view and edit your tabulature in a format that is easy 
		to understand. It also shows the fully rendered output. You can listen to  
        the current piece using its audio playback. </p>
		<p>Behind the scenes, LuteScribe works closely with the TAB program to 
		create attractive typeset output. All the formatting commands of TAB can 
		be used in your LuteScribe content.</p>
		<p>LuteScribe can open tabulature written in the following formats: 
		<a href="import.htm">TAB, 
		Fronimo (FT3, FT2), Fandango (JTZ, JTXML)</a>, and its own LSML format, based on XML.</p>
		<p>You can preview your tabulature, or save as PDF or print it out - see
		<a href="printing-save-pdf.htm">preview, printing and saving as PDF.</a></p>
		<h3>Quick Start Tutorial</h3>
		<p>You can get started using the simple <a href="quick-start.htm">quick 
		start tutorial</a>, then explore the <a href="menus.htm">menus</a> and
		<a href="editing.htm">general editing behaviour</a> of LuteScribe.</p>
		<h3>License</h3>
		<p>LuteScribe is released under the <a href="gnu-gpl3.htm">GNU Public 
		License version 3</a>. </p>
		<h3>Relationship to TAB</h3>
		<p>TAB is a mature tabulature typesetting program that uses a text based 
		format to author the tabulature. The TAB input text format is related to 
		the final typset and provides a wide range of powerful typesetting 
		commands.</p>
		<p>However the TAB text format is not particularly easy to read from as it is rotated and upside 
		down compared to the final typeset content, and the visual appearance is 
		not familiar to lute players. As a result most writers of 
		tabulature tend to prefer a GUI editor that is dedicated to writing 
		tabulature.</p>
		<p>LuteScribe works in conjunction with TAB, whilst at the same time 
		providing a familiar user interface so what you see during editing is 
		close enough to final ouput format that you can play from - see 
		screenshot below. See further details about how
		<a href="relationship-to-tab.htm">LuteScribe builds on the strengths of 
		TAB and works around its 
		shortcomings.</a></p>
